Everyone's favorite bossy baby, *Angelica*, dreamed up the Rugrats because she was lonely. Dill seems to be the only baby that is also **real**, as he is the only one she can't make disappear when she becomes frustrated with him. Ever wonder why he was the only baby who didn't talk? It's because he was the only baby who was real. So, if the other babies are figments of her imagination, where did they come from? Well...

## Chuckie Died In A Car Accident

We all remember that Chuckie's dad is a bit *neurotic*, and that his mom *died* in a car accident. This theory suggests that Chuckie ***died in the car accident as well***, making Chuckie's dad to be even more off-kilter.

## Stu Makes Toys In The Basement Because...

Tommy is a **stillborn**. After Tommy died at birth, Stu Pickles went pretty nuts, and spent all of his time making toys in the basement as a way to deal with his grief.

## Phil And Lil Were Identical Because...

Ever wonder how Phil and Lil were fraternal twins, yet also identical? This theory suggests that the DeVilles *terminated their pregnancy* and aborted Phil and Lil before their biological sex was identified. Angelica knows they would have been twins, so she simply **assigns them each a sex,** as she doesn't know any better because, well, she's a kid.

## Where Does Angelica's Twisted Imagination Come From?

Well, it seems like Angelica has a pretty dark history herself. According to this theory, that [doll Angelica is always carrying around](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/The_Rugrats_Theory "one more theory that involves Cynthia") — you know, the ratty looking one with the blond hair sticking out? Supposedly, this doll reminds her of her biological mother, who ~~was a drug addict, and~~ is dead. Charlotte, on the other hand, her step-mother, is the opposite of her dead mother, and is overly focused on her career. Though perhaps more functional, Charlotte never gives Angelica much love or attention, so Angelica feels lonely and like she has to make up her friends to have fun — and perhaps, have people to exert some control over.
